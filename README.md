# Sertrav

I made this program for a travel agency owned by a relative of mine, named serres travel in my home city Serres, Greece.
It reads the names of the customers from a .txt file named List and then it makes a plan regarding
where they will sit each day of a trip. This is made to ensure that every customer will eventually sit 
in each part of the bus (front, middle back etc) so everyone will be happy and no one will complain about
a "bad" seat.
