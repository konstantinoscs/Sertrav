# Sertrav

I made this program after the request of a travel agency in my home city Serres, Greece.
It reads the names of the customers from a .txt file named List and then it makes a plan regarding
where they will sit each day of a trip. This is made to ensure that every customer will eventually sit 
in each part of the bus (front, middle back etc) so everyone will be happy and no one will complain about
a "bad" seat.

Ignore the serres travel prev.

Update: A c++ version with GUI will be out soon!
Edit: c++ gui version is ready but unpublished due to Qt dependencies issues.
