# Sertrav

I made this programm for a travel agency owned by a relative of mine, named serres travel in my home city Serres, Greece.
It reads the names of the customers from a .txt file named List and then it makes a plan regarding
where they will sit each day of a trip. This is made to ensure that every customer will eventually sit 
in each part of the bus (front, middle back etc) so everyone will be happy and no one will complain about
a "bad" seat. 
In other words this is a 100% applied programming project already used from those who reauested it.
Apparently it was a succesfull project beacause some of the agency's partners wanted to aquire it 
as well (and I was happy to give it to them ).
Although I had no intend of making money out of this programm, the travel agency was happy to give me a free
trip and some money for the time I saved them dealing with dissatisified customers.
